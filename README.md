# Chaotic Street (Phố Loạn)

Chaotic Street is an educational game that highlights the danger of jaywalking and encourages the players to follow the traffic law. In this Frogger-themed game, the player acts as a pedestrian trying to cross the roads safely by going on the zebra crossings and bypassing the flow of incoming traffic. The game was developed entirely in Swift and SwiftUI for iOS and iPadOS.
